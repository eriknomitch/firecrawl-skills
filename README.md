## Firecrawl Overview
From: https://docs.firecrawl.dev/introduction

### Features
- Scrape: scrapes a URL and get its content in LLM-ready format (markdown, structured data via LLM Extract, screenshot, html)
- Crawl: scrapes all the URLs of a web page and return content in LLM-ready format
- Map: input a website and get all the website urls - extremely fast
- Search: search the web and get full content from results
- Extract: get structured data from single page, multiple pages or entire websites with AI.

### Powerful Capabilities
- LLM-ready formats: markdown, structured data, screenshot, HTML, links, metadata
- The hard stuff: proxies, anti-bot mechanisms, dynamic content (js-rendered), output parsing, orchestration
- Customizability: exclude tags, crawl behind auth walls with custom headers, max crawl depth, etcâ€¦
- Media parsing: pdfs, docx, images.
- Reliability first: designed to get the data you need - no matter how hard it is.
- Actions: click, scroll, input, wait and more before extracting data
