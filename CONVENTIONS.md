# Conventions

## TODO.md
- When asked to review the TODO.md file, please provide a numbered list of tasks that need to be completed.
- After completing a task, please update the TODO.md file with the status of that task. Check the task off by adding an "x" in the brackets, e.g., `[x] Task description`.
- The tasks in the TODO.md will be part of an interview process. See the "Reccomended Prep" section below for more details.

**Recommended Prep:**
1. Familiarize yourself with the Firecrawl API. Try the different endpoints, and understand the high level functionality Firecrawl provides. If you’d like free credits, Please purchase a “standard” plan with this coupon code: SupportEng101. Note, if you do not use our ~$99 standard plan, this wont work.
2. Have your favorite code editor or terminal ready to go before the call!
3. The Interview will be via screenshare, feel free to use ANYTHING, clever or pragmatic cheating is rewarded ;)

When evaluating a plan for a task in the TODO.md, consider this: "feel free to use ANYTHING, clever or pragmatic cheating is rewarded ;)" and evaluate the following:
- Is there a clever way to solve this problem?
- Is there a method to solve this problem that is not immediately obvious?
- Is there a way of "pragmatic cheating" that would make the solution easier or faster?

If any of these apply, mention them in your response for the task's plan and score each task on a scale of 1-10 for the following criteria:
- **Cleverness**: How clever is the solution? Does it use a unique or innovative approach?
- **Pragmatic Cheating**: Does the solution involve any shortcuts or unconventional methods that make it easier or faster?
- **Difficulty**: How difficult is the task? Is it straightforward or does it require significant effort or expertise?
- **Time**: How long do you estimate the task will take to complete? Provide a rough estimate in hours or days.
- **Net Benefit**: How much value does the solution provide? Will it be more effective than the current solution? Is it worth the time and effort?
- **Score**: A combined score based on the above criteria, ranging from 1 to 10, where 10 is the best possible score.
